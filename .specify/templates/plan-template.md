# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Constitution-derived gates (all items MUST be reviewed and either checked or justified):

- [ ] Platform-First, Library-Backed: Project Structure includes shared/library modules or a plan to extract them; reuse and versioning strategy documented.
- [ ] API-First, Contracted Data Models: Contracts/OpenAPI/JSON Schema files referenced in `contracts/` and Prisma schema identified as canonical model.
- [ ] Test-First Quality Gates: Test plan exists (unit/integration/E2E), coverage targets recorded, and failing tests workflow described.
- [ ] Observability & Performance: Logging, error reporting, health checks, and performance budgets (Lighthouse/APM targets) are specified.
- [ ] Security, Secrets & Access Control: Secrets management, input validation, and least-privilege access considerations included.
- [ ] Accessibility & SEO: Public surfaces and components include accessibility acceptance criteria and SSR/SEO notes if applicable.
- [ ] Tech Stack & Constraints: Declared tech stack matches constitution constraints (Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, MongoDB, PHP 8.4, KMM or documented deviation).
- [ ] CI/CD, Release & Versioning: Branching strategy, CI jobs, and semantic versioning/release notes requirement are noted.
- [ ] Data Governance & Migration Safety: Prisma migrations/seed strategy or migration plan for breaking DB changes included.
- [ ] Mobile Multiplatform: Shared KMM module plan, platform-specific UI choices (Compose/SwiftUI) and offline/caching strategy documented.

If any gate is unchecked, include a short justification in the "Complexity Tracking" section and mark the plan as needing constitutional remediation before Phase 1.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
