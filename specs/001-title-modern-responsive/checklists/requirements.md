# Specification Quality Checklist: Modern responsive website + mobile apps

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: D:\laragon\www\nexus_platform\specs\001-title-modern-responsive\spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - Result: PASS — implementation-specific choices moved to the "Implementation Assumptions (non-binding)" section of the spec; stakeholder-facing sections contain no implementation leakage.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (spec defines them)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - Result: PASS — implementation details are explicitly sectioned under "Implementation Assumptions (non-binding)" and do not alter user-facing requirements.

## Validation Findings

1. Initial validation flagged implementation details present in the spec Input and Constitution Compliance. Remediation performed: implementation-specific stack choices were moved into a dedicated "Implementation Assumptions (non-binding)" section in the spec.

2. Current status: Spec meets stakeholder-facing quality criteria. Implementation assumptions remain documented for planning and are acceptable per user request.

## Checklist Status

- Overall: COMPLETE — spec validated and ready for Phase 1 planning. The user explicitly accepted inclusion of implementation assumptions.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to Phase 1: generate quickstart.md, concrete Prisma schema (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`), and detailed contracts if desired.
- Optionally generate `tasks.md` mapping user stories to implementable tasks.
