# Feature Specification: Modern responsive website + mobile apps

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-modern-responsive`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Responsive site and mobile apps presenting top programming languages, with browse, detail, bookmark, testimonials, contact, admin management, analytics, offline-capable mobile views, accessibility and CI/CD"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Browse & Discover Languages (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to view a responsive list of programming languages with rankings, details and trends so I can discover and compare languages.

Why this priority: This is the primary public-facing value and the fastest path to user engagement.

Independent Test: Load the homepage on desktop and mobile, verify languages grid renders, details page opens for an item, and trend visualization displays meaningful data.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. **Given** the homepage, **When** the visitor opens the page on desktop or mobile, **Then** they see the language grid with images, titles, short summary and ranking.
2. **Given** a language in the grid, **When** the visitor taps/clicks it, **Then** the language detail page opens with trend visualization and related resources.

### User Story 2 - Bookmark & Personalized List (Priority: P1)

As a signed-in user, I want to bookmark languages so I can return to my favorites quickly.

Why this priority: Increases retention and enables personalization flows.

Independent Test: Sign in, bookmark a language, verify it appears in the user's bookmarks view and persists across sessions.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they bookmark a language, **Then** the language appears in their personal bookmarks list.
2. **Given** a bookmarked language, **When** the user unbookmarks it, **Then** it is removed from their list.

---

### User Story 3 - Submit Testimonial & Contact (Priority: P2)

As a site visitor, I want to submit a testimonial and contact form so I can provide feedback or contribute content.

Why this priority: Provides community content and feedback channel.

Independent Test: Submit testimonial form with required fields; verify success message and that the testimonial is recorded for moderation.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. **Given** the testimonial form, **When** the visitor submits valid input, **Then** the system records the testimonial and displays success acknowledgment.
2. **Given** invalid input, **When** the visitor submits, **Then** validation errors are shown preventing submission.

---

### User Story 4 - Admin Manage Languages & Analytics (Priority: P2)

As an administrator, I want to create, update and delete language entries and view platform analytics so I can maintain content and monitor performance.

Why this priority: Content management enables accurate, up-to-date information and supports operational needs.

Independent Test: As an admin, create a language entry via admin UI, confirm it appears in the public listing; view analytics dashboard showing visits and engagement metrics.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. **Given** an admin session, **When** the admin creates a language record, **Then** it appears in the public list within the expected propagation time.
2. **Given** the analytics view, **When** the admin opens it, **Then** metrics (pageviews, bookmarks, conversions) are displayed.

---

### User Story 5 - Mobile Offline & Performance (Priority: P3)

As a mobile user, I want offline access to previously viewed language data and fast, responsive UI so the app is useful with intermittent connectivity.

Why this priority: Improves mobile user experience and reduces perceived latency.

Independent Test: On a mobile device, view language detail, go offline, reopen the detail and verify cached data is shown and UI remains functional for offline-capable features.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. **Given** previously visited content, **When** the device is offline, **Then** the content is available from cache and displays accurately.
2. **Given** the app is online, **When** the user navigates, **Then** perceived latency remains within acceptable bounds defined in Success Criteria.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the backend is unavailable: pages should show clear error messaging and limited offline capabilities where possible.
- How are duplicate testimonials handled: submissions are deduplicated by content hash and timestamp; near-duplicates flagged for moderation.
- Large media uploads: enforce client-side limits and provide clear progress and error states.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST present a responsive homepage with a languages grid accessible on desktop and mobile.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide a language detail view with trend visualization and related resources.
- **FR-003**: Authenticated users MUST be able to bookmark/unbookmark languages and retrieve their bookmark list.
- **FR-004**: Visitors MUST be able to submit testimonials and a contact form; submissions require validation and moderation for testimonials.
- **FR-005**: Administrators MUST be able to create, update and delete language records via a protected admin interface.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide an analytics view for admin showing pageviews, bookmarks, and engagement metrics.
- **FR-007**: Mobile clients MUST support offline viewing of previously fetched language details.
- **FR-008**: All user-facing pages MUST include accessibility attributes and basic SEO metadata for public surfaces.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST implement client-visible error handling for unavailable backend services.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST validate and sanitize all user-submitted content before persisting or exposing it publicly.

_Assumptions_: Public content is non-sensitive; standard email-based authentication is sufficient for initial release; moderation workflow is manual for v1.

## Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: id, name, email, role (user/admin), bookmarks[]
- **Language**: id, name, summary, ranking, trendData, resources[], images[]
- **Testimonial**: id, authorName, content, status (pending/approved/rejected), createdAt
- **Bookmark**: id, userId, languageId, createdAt
- **FeatureItem**: id, title, description, icon
- **AnalyticsEvent**: eventType, userId(optional), languageId(optional), timestamp

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of homepage views must render the primary content (language grid) within 2 seconds on a 4G mobile connection (perceived user-facing load time).
- **SC-002**: Bookmark and testimonial operations must succeed end-to-end in 99% of cases under normal load.
- **SC-003**: Offline-capable views should display cached details for previously visited items in 100% of offline test runs.
- **SC-004**: Accessibility checks: 100% of public pages must pass a baseline automated accessibility scan and manual spot checks for WCAG AA basics.
- **SC-005**: Error handling: When backend is unavailable, user-facing pages must show a clear error state within 3 seconds of failed requests.
- **SC-006**: User satisfaction: At least 85% of beta testers report the app as "responsive and usable" in a first-release usability survey.

## Constitution Compliance (mandatory)

- Principle mapping:

  - Platform-First, Library-Backed Architecture
  - API-First, Contracted Data Models
  - Test-First Quality Gates
  - Observability, Monitoring & Performance
  - Security, Accessibility & Deployment Discipline
  - Mobile Multiplatform & Native UX Guarantees
  - CI/CD, Release & Versioning Policy
  - Data Governance & Migration Safety

- Contract files:

  - `specs/001-title-modern-responsive/contracts/openapi.yaml` (to be created for public API contracts)

- Test Strategy:

  - Unit tests for core logic and components (frontend: app/components/**, backend: src/**).
  - Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions (backend/tests/integration).
  - Contract tests for public APIs (tests/contract).
  - E2E tests for critical user flows: browse, bookmark, submit testimonial, admin manage (playwright/tests or equivalent).
  - Coverage targets: statement >80%, branch >75% where feasible; specify exceptions in the plan.

- Migration impact:
  - Schema changes requiring migrations MUST be implemented via an migrations framework and seed scripts; specific tooling is an implementation assumption documented below.
  - Backwards-incompatible changes require a documented migration plan and compatibility strategy.

## Implementation Assumptions (non-binding)

The following technology choices are recorded as assumptions for planning and execution. They are intentionally kept separate from the stakeholder-facing specification and may be revised in the implementation plan.

- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.2 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript (strict), Shadcn/UI components, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript, Express or Koa
- ORM / Schema: Prisma (>=5.x) with migrations (implementation detail for backend teams)
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas recommended) as primary datastore
- PHP fallback: PHP 8.4 for server-side fallback pages
- Mobile: Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) for shared business logic; Jetpack Compose (Android) and SwiftUI (iOS) for native UI
- Testing & CI: Jest/RTL, Supertest, Playwright, Testcontainers, GitHub Actions

_Note_: These are implementation assumptions and do not alter user-facing requirements or success criteria. They are included here to aid planning and should be referenced in the plan and tasks.
